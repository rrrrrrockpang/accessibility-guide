This document gives an overview for instructors and teaching assistants to improve course accessibility for students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). Whether you don’t know where to start, or want to double-check whether any accessibility concerns may have been missed around your materials, we hope that this document will help you. We believe that increasing accessibility makes the course more approachable to all students. This guide will help you do that efficiently. Intended Audience Instructors and TAs who are teaching math or CS classes, or anyone interested in making accessible course materials including PowerPoint slides, computational notebooks, and homework write-ups. This guide was made possible at CSE 547 at UW, where we collaborated with the UW Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences (CREATE) and UW Disability Resources for Students (DRS). We also received valuable feedback from Esteban Safranchik, Ken Gu, and Katharina Reinecke. While many examples herein focus on computer science course content, we hope that this guide will benefit instructors across courses and disciplines. We warmly welcome feedback and suggestions to improve this guide. If you have comments, please reach out to ✉️ Rock Yuren Pang. We also welcome additional feedback to improve this document. ",

This document focuses on students with visual impairments. There are many students with a range of disabilities, with a variety of access needs who may require accommodations to succeed in higher education courses.

    "title": "Common Barriers in CS Classrooms",
    "content": "PowerPoint Slides . Imagine a blind student trying to understand matrix multiplication in a highly animated PowerPoint slide. The image of a matrix that you animated happened to be a screenshot from a textbook. Under that scenario, sighted students can easily understand the transformation with the engaging slide, but blind students will likely be completely lost. A key takeaway to making PowerPoint slides is not to completely rely on visual cues. You should always consider adding alt text to images, animations, and math notations. If visual cues are important, you can consider augmenting the experience with tactile graphics (braille). Computational notebook software, such as Google Colab . makes it easier to collaborate and share code. However, screen reader users cannot access and work with these notebooks, as of this writing. To make computational notebooks more accessible, you can easily create separate Python files for each section of your notebook. Additionally, blind users may not be able to create visualizations as homework deliverables. Instead, you can consider having them present the information in an alternate format to test the correctness (e.g., a data table). Document assignments . PDFs are often inaccessible to people using screen readers by default. We recommend releasing the Markdown and LaTeX files whenever possible. It is easy to use pandoc to convert a Markdown/LaTeX file with math notations to an accessible HTML file supported by MathJax, which works with screen readers (see section 4). In-class activities . In-class discussions are often accessible by default if they don’t heavily rely on a visual component. However, if your in-class activity needs to focus on a visual element (e.g., discussing the drawbacks between k-means and hierarchical clustering), it helps if you can provide tactile graphics. The Disability Resources for Students can help create these from images and slides. Group project . It helps to talk with the students ahead of time to understand what accommodations they might need for a project. In team-based projects, sometimes students like to focus on a certain part of the project, e.g., literature review, giving presentations, or writing, instead of more inaccessible elements (e.g., analyzing visualizations). Now that you have a high-level understanding of where you may encounter accessibility issues in your class, the next few sections are going to expand on each point and guide you through concrete steps to make them more accessible.

    "content": "Here are high-level recommendations on how to proceed in a class to improve accessibility for BLV students. | Communicate before the quarter. To accommodate the needs of different students, we recommend communicating with the students before the quarter. Ask them if they need additional accommodations like accessible PowerPoint and coding/homework setup. | Communicate with DRS. You should communicate with the DRS if this document doesn’t cover the specific needs. Also, it’s helpful to print out necessary braille materials at the beginning of the quarter. The DRS is helpful and the turnaround is usually within 2 weeks. | Make the accessible slides publicly. Make the accessible slides publicly available on the course website so that all students have the chance to preview the slides if they would like to. Share the accessible materials (e.g., braille) with the students one week before the class session. | Test the server before launching homework or Colab activities. Before releasing the homework or Colab on a server, please test that the code can run on the server without configuration issues. Configuration issues can be significant overhead burdens to BVI students. Any unexpected configuration errors can significantly hurt student’s confidence to succeed in the class. | Always adjust the needs of individual students. Note that each student might have different access needs, and preferences to navigate accessibility barriers. Please discuss with them throughout the course for feedback. | . ",
