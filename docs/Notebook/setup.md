# Set up your Server Environment
{: .fs-9 }

This section will show you how to set up your server environment. We will use the CSE server as an example.

## 1. Contact IT Support

Contact [support@cs.washington.edu](support@cs.washington.edu) to create a folder in `attu1` and add r/w permissions to the students based on their NetID. You can set up your homework/Colab code there. The students can also work on them there. Donâ€™t use UW cycle servers; you will run into permission issues.

Sometimes, `attu1` can be slow. Please contact IT support to set up a new server (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) if you need a more stable server for class purpose.

Once you have the folder set up, you can `git clone` your [homework/Colab code]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/notebook/organize#2-divide-the-colab-document-into-separate-python-scripts) there.
