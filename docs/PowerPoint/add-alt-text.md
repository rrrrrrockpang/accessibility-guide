# Add Alternative Text
{: .fs-9 }

Alternative (Alt) Text conveys the “why” of the image as it relates to the content of a document or webpage. It is read aloud to users by screen reader software, and it is indexed by search engines. It also displays on the page if the image fails to load, as in this example of a missing image.

Please see this [guide](http://diagramcenter.org/table-of-contents-2.html) for instructions on how to write good alt text. 

Missing alt text is a common barrier for students with visual impairment. Make sure you add alt text to any important graphics. When we [checked accessibility earlier]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/PowerPoint/check-accessibility/#2-check-the-accessibility-panel), you might also notice that many images are missing alternative (alt) text in the Check Accessibility panel. We will now show how to add alt text in different scenarios.
